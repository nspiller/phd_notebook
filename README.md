# PhD thesis Jupiter notebook
Code for the figures and tables in my [PhD thesis](TODO:keeperlink).
Data processing is done in a Jupiter notebook, which can be downloaded or explored interactively in a [binder](TODO:binderlink).

The original output files of the quantum chemical calculions are stored in a [keeper archive](TODO:keeperlink). 
The archive further contains all files necessary to rerun calculations. 
The Jupiter notebook serves as the road map to find the respective calculation files for each figure and table in the thesis.
